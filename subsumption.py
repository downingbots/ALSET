    # run foreground NN first. Return probabilities of actions, type of actions.

    # as a parameter, give chosen [ACTION, prob] 

    # If a right type of arm/base action, Run NN or automatic function

    # Return probability of NN for fields specified to be added in (e.g., LEFT).
    # - return delta of left vs. straight?
    # Use maximum of Action prob vs. Stay_on_table prob?

    # how to train DQN with subsumption: 
    # 1: gather end-to-end data from Func App for DQN training.
    # 2: train DQN using ROBOT_OFF_TABLE_PENALTY during DQN runs

    # how do we clean up NNs?
