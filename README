This is SIRjetbot1. The SIR stands for Sharper Image Robot, which I purchased on clearance for less than $20. The 1 is because we bought 3 of them that worked.

The Sharper Image robot was hacked as followed:

    - Jetson Nano Developer Board with wifi
    - raspberry pi camera v2 with 2 ft cable
    - mounted on a cookie wheel case
    - A hacked RC:
        - the inside of the low-end RC control that came with the robot. 
        - You can see/use the buttons here control the robot. 
        - the other side of the board was soldered to wire it up with the IO expansion board.
    - The IO expansion board was required because the RC control uses Tri-state logic on 6 pins. It uses I2C to communicate with the Jetson Development board
    - It is powered by a mongo BONAI 5.6A battery pack
    - Logitech gamepad

Started with the Jetson Notebook tutorial on Obstacle avoidance, but changed it significantly. The Notebook tutorials barely ran on my Jetson with the wifi connectivity from my working area. I replaced the tutorials with:

    - The Logitech joystick controls the robot directly
    - The camera is streamed using much lower overhead video webserver for teleoperation.
    - The images are saved directly to the Robot SD card.

I implemented a poor-man's pwm which can change the commands to start/stop up to every tenth of a second or so. Currently, takes the picture when stopped.  It records the command sent by the joystick (lower or upper arm up/down, open/close gripper, etc.)
    This data is then gathered and used to train the robot.

The robot runs in 3 modes: RC telepresence, data-capture, and using the trained neural net.  Multiple apps can be incorporated: currently there are the single alexnet NN, and the 8-part functional chain of AlexNets.

The 8-parts are:
    get the arm to a known position
    looks for objects on the floor (or table)
    goes to object
    pick up the object
    look for the box
    goes to the box
    drops object in box
    backs up and park arm

No falling off table (or going out-of-bounds)

The Jetson "notebook" is a cool idea for tutorials, but in practice needs very fast wifi - better than my house has and very fast SSD - faster than I bought.  But putting the gamepad/logitech on the robot and using lower overhead video webstreaming worked fine.
